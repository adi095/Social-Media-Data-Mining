 1. Explain why unary ratings are significantly different from other types of ratings in the design of recommender systems.
 2. Discuss cases in which content-based recommendations will not perform as well as ratings-based collaborative filtering.
 3. Suppose you set up a system, where a guided visual interface is used in order to determine the product of interest to a customer.
    What category of recommender system does this case fall into?
 4. Discuss a scenario in which location plays an important role in the recommendation process.
 5. The chapter mentions the fact that collaborative filtering can be viewed as a generalization of the classification problem. 
    Discuss a simple method to generalize classification algorithms to collaborative filtering. 
    Explain why it is difficult to use such methods in the context of sparse ratings matrices.
 6. Suppose that you had a recommender system that could predict raw ratings. How would you use it to design a top-k recommender system? 
    Discuss the computational complexity of such a system in terms of the number of applications of the base prediction algorithm. 
    Under what circumstances would such an approach become impractical
